# ToolHive - simplify and secure MCP servers

**Run any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server ‚Äî securely, instantly, anywhere.**

ToolHive is the easiest way to discover, deploy, and manage MCP servers. Launch
any MCP server in a locked-down container with just a few clicks. No manual
setup, no security headaches, no runtime hassles.

## Why ToolHive?

- **Instant deployment:** Start any MCP server with a simple graphical workflow.
- **Secure by default:** Every server runs in an isolated container with only
  the permissions it needs. Secrets are managed securely, never in plaintext.
- **Works everywhere:** Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Seamless integration:** ToolHive auto-configures popular clients like GitHub
  Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, and more.

## Getting started

To get started with ToolHive, download the latest release from
[the website](https://toolhive.dev/download/) and follow the
[quickstart guide](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive/tutorials/quickstart-ui).

---

## How it works

Under the hood, ToolHive runs each MCP server in its own secure container and
exposes an HTTP/SSE proxy that MCP clients connect to.

</picture>

For more advanced use cases, ToolHive is also available as a command-line tool
which can be used standalone or side-by-side with the ToolHive UI and as a
Kubernetes Operator. Learn more in the
[ToolHive documentation](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive/).

## Privacy and Telemetry

ToolHive uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking and performance
monitoring to help us identify and fix issues, improve stability, and enhance
the user experience. This telemetry is enabled by default but completely
optional.

### What data is collected?

- Error reports and crash logs
- Performance metrics
- Usage patterns

### How to opt out

You can easily disable telemetry at any time:

1. Open ToolHive
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the top navigation)
3. Find the **Telemetry** section
4. Toggle off telemetry collection
